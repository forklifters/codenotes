- create subproject for simple-node-server (sns.js) and 
pull in the sns (so it can be used in other projects)

- make files clickable

- separate js from html
- hardcode a "dataroot" for text files (i.e. ./data)
- what is file nameing convention (part of SCHEMA consideration)
- consider if all files should be in a 'root' directory (SCHEMA/ ACCESS, this question deals with our version of db.connect())
- or, should we traverse sub directories? (SCHEMA)
- add requirements for metadata, what fields? where to keep it?
- jslint from commandline
- create and add instructions to devnotes.txt
- think about js directory (do we need it)
- perhaps add unit tests?
